 * CLEANUP: Removed all trailing whitespace from all source-files.  This avoids many GIT (merge) warnings.
[Mar 12 2009]

 * MODIFIED: Renamed concat_atom/2,3 into atomic_list_concat/2,3 for compatibility.  Moved the old predicates into library(backcomp).  It is adviced to update your code, but 99% of the code will remain working because the old definitions are autoloaded.

   versions.  After tip by Ulrich Neumerkel.
