 * MODIFIED: Make initialization/1 ISO compliant
   This patch is a modest cleanup to the implementation of '$load_file'/3
   from init.pl and provides an ISO compatible implementation of
   initialization/1. This executes the argument goal *after* loading the
   file rather than when encountering the directive. Often this makes no
   difference, but notably load_foreign_library/1 is an exception.
   Therefore we added use_foreign_library/1,2 that act as a directive and
   provides proper integration with saved-states automatically.  Loading
   code using initialization(load_foreign_library(...)) will load the
   library immediately and issue a warning.
   
   See initialization/1,2 for details and further hints for dealing with
   possible compatibility problems.

 * CLEANUP: Removed all trailing whitespace from all source-files.  This avoids many GIT (merge) warnings.

 * MODIFIED: Renamed concat_atom/2,3 into atomic_list_concat/2,3 for compatibility.  Moved the old predicates into library(backcomp).  It is adviced to update your code, but 99% of the code will remain working because the old definitions are autoloaded.
