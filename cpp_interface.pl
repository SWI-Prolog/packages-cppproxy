%
%	Declare Goal1, ... to  be  callable   from  C++.  Callable goals
%	consist of a head, specifying the argument types and optional an
%	" = Options", where  Options  is   a  list  of  options. Defined
%	options are:
%
%		* one
%		Predicate always succeeds.  This is the default.  Such
%		predicates are mapped to void C++ functions.
%
%		* zero_or_one
%		Predicate succeeds or fails.
%
%		* zero_or_more
%		Predicate is non-deterministic.
%
%		* as(Name)
%		Name to give to the C++ function or Query class.
